      "fullDescription": "\nDescription Go up Mount Teide by Cable Car Enjoy the quickest way to go up Mount Teide. When you get off the cable car, you will be at an altitude of 3,555 m, and will have various choices on how to take in the stunning views of the largest national park in the Canary Islands. Choose the viewpoint of La Rambleta to behold the views of the Siete Cañadas and the Ucanca Valley . From here, you can just imagine the enormous size of the old volcano that stood atop the island 150,000 years ago, and which was known as the Cañadas edifice, at a time when Mount Teide did not yet exist. In front of you stretches the Las Cañadas cirque, which has its highest point on Montaña Guajara . These are the remains of a great volcano whose own weight caused it to slide towards the northern coast in no more than a few minutes. Its remains, millions of tons of volcanic rock, lie scattered over hundreds of kilometres in the depths of the ocean. In the huge tunnel left by the collapse of the volcano, new eruptions began immediately, and began to fill it. One of these eruptions was the origin of Mount Teide. Over a long period of time, eruption followed eruption, forming the huge volcano from which you are now looking out at the surrounding landscape. If you prefer to gaze at spectacular views of La Gomera, El Hierro and La Palma with an impressive crater at your feet, (which once upon a time was a lake of lava), choose the path to the Pico Viejo Viewpoint , another colossal volcano over 3,000 m high, the second highest peak in the archipelago, crowned by a crater 800 m in diameter. Pico Viejo forms part of the same volcanic edifice as Mount Teide, and at its base lie the Narices del Teide [literally: the nostrils of Mount Teide], the two mouths of historic eruptions, including the last one recorded within the bounds of the National Park. You can take this tour of great scenic and volcanic interest with a guide, by booking the guided tour to the Pico Viejo viewpoint with a cable car ticket included. Choose the La Fortaleza trail if you’d like to enjoy fantastic views of northern Tenerife: the outstanding valley of La Orotava, with Puerto de la Cruz on the ocean shore, although for most of the year, the valley is shrouded in clouds borne by the trade winds from the north east. As they collide with the island’s northern slopes, these winds rise up, and the moisture carried along by them condenses, until it forms a spectacular sea of cloud, which is vital to sustain Tenerife’s forests. You may also like to take this trail if you want to make your descent via Montaña Blanca. And if you are one of those people who won’t leave Tenerife without having reached the summit of Mt. Teide, choose the Telesforo Bravo trail to the peak of Teide and shout ‘I am the King of the world’ from an altitude of 3 718 m. But remember that for the trail that leads to the crater, you will need a special permit , issued by administration of the Teide National Park , which you must apply for months in advance. Would you like a guide for this option? Read all the information on our ascent to the peak with a cable car ticket . Use the Teide Cable Car Online Tickets and take advantage of their benefits Guarantee your seat by purchasing your Mount Teide Cable Car tickets online. You will enjoy tickets with an assigned session. It is as simple as booking a time slot for a specific date. You must show up at the Cable Car boarding area with your Online Ticket, either printed or displayed on your mobile phone, 20 minutes prior to the time specified on your Mount Teide Cable Car ticket in order to redeem it and access the boarding area to board the cabin afterwards. If you arrive by private vehicle, which you will need to park, we recommend that you show up at the premises of the Cable Car prior to the time indicated on your Mount Teide Cable Car tickets, although we recommend that you avoid driving and choose collective transportation instead because it is important that together we do what we can to counteract overuse of the vehicle parking areas in the National Park. In addition, this represents your personal commitment to reduce greenhouse gases and to the conservation of the National Park. As a conservation measure, they have been kept to a small size, and they cannot be extended. Which is why we offer you our tour to Mount Teide with cable car tickets included . If you finally arrive by car, it is best that you book your Mount Teide Cable Car tickets for a time slot after 1.00pm. If for whatever reason you arrive too late for your session, you will lose the right to board. Tickets + Guided tour to the Pico Viejo viewpoint Would you like to ascend by cable car and also walk some of the trails with a guide? You got it! By booking this guided tour you will be able to discover all of the volcanic wonders that surround the impressive trail to the Pico Viejo viewpoint. Our guide will explain everything to you in Spanish or English. Please bear in mind that this activity is not suitable for people with mobility problems and children under 5. Tickets + ‘ Teide Legend ’ digital audio guide to Teide National Park or physical audio guide to the trails The perfect option if you’re travelling to Teide with your own vehicle and you prefer to discover the landscape and find out about it under your own steam with the help of our Teide Legend audio guide (available in English, German, Spanish, French, Russian, Italian, Polish and Dutch for download on Android and iOS devices). The audio guide included in this ticket is actually a full audio-guided tour of Teide National Park. The Teide Legend audio guide included with your cable car + audio guide ticket is an audio-guided tour to Mount Teide. It reveals the natural and cultural heritage of Tenerife and different points of interest in Teide National Park, depending on the access road you take to reach our facilities. This audio-guided tour shows you the best viewpoints and hiking trails near the cable car base and top stations, plus restaurants, local shops, cultural centres, etc. Characters from the “Legend of Guayota” will be your guides on this tour, and you’ll learn about the volcanology, anthropology, and history of the National Park, while you’ll be also introduced to the indigenous Guanches, Tenerife’s earliest inhabitants who worshipped the Teide volcano, and who believed its eruptions to be the expressions of the fury of the gods. The section on trails at the top station offers detailed and essential information about the three emblematic trails that leave from Teide Cable Car top station and follow different routes across the volcano’s slopes. You can hike the trails at the same time as you learn about the most important and characteristic parts of the volcano. The audio guide is fun and easy to use! You just need to use the booking code from your cable car + audio guide ticket to quickly and easily download the app and enjoy a complete contactless experience. Want to know how the audio guide app works? We explain in this video. Follow the instructions to get the most from your visit to Mount Teide. If you do not have a smartphone, you can receive a physical audio guide . In order to pick it up you must leave a cash deposit of €20 per audio guide or €50 per each set of two audio guides . The amount deposited will be returned to you when you return the audio guide. It’s important to remember that, by choosing this option, you’ll only have the audio guide to the trails at the top station. Live the Teide Legend at the Teide “Science and Legend” exhibition! The cable car ticket (except for the ticket for the ascent and the Cable Car at Sunset activity) includes free admission to the “Science and Legend” exhibition , which you will find at the Teide Cable Car Visitors’ Centre. You will learn about Mount Teide’s last major eruption (around 1,000 years ago) which the indigenous Guanches probably interpreted as a fight between mythological deities —an explanation far removed from that which science now attributes to volcanic eruptions. The characters of the legend of Guayota, both gods and humans, will show you their vision of the stages of the eruption that took place back then, and which formed the pylon at the summit of Mount Teide, known locally as “el tapón del Teide” [the Teide cap]. A magical story in which good and evil join in an epic battle. Along with the legend, you will be shown reliable data to illustrate the scientific interpretation of the eruption. Although the two perspectives may seem diametrically opposed, they are in fact closely connected. In addition, you can have a great time at our Visitors’ Centre, where you can find brilliant mementoes of your visit to the legend of the Teide National Park at our official souvenir shop . And you can relax and enjoy a culinary experience with panoramic views of the National Park in Spain’s highest restaurant and snack bar , whose badge of identity is the distinctly Canary Island character of its food and drink. If you book the cable car + audio guide ticket, the Teide Legend app is included with your purchase, and it features detailed audio recordings so you can enjoy the exhibition in any of the audio guide’s 8 languages. Teide Tour: the most rewarding excursion to ascend Mount Teide by cable car If you wish to contribute to the conservation and care of the Teide National Park, the best way to visit is using group transport—and a guide! This will help to reduce atmospheric pollution, and we can fight climate change together; at the same time, you will get to know more about this jewel of the natural world, thanks to the explanations given by our guides. On this guided visit to the Teide National Park (available every day, and with pick-ups in the north and south of the island, and the metropolitan area of Santa Cruz de Tenerife and Candelaria) , you will ascend to an altitude of 3,555 metres by cable car. Once there, you can enjoy free access to the trails leading to wonderful viewing points, where you can marvel at northern Tenerife’s characteristic ‘sea of clouds’—or at the spectacular views of Pico Viejo, southern Tenerife, and some of the neighbouring islands on the horizon. It also includes a free digital audio guide to the trails at the cable car top station and entry to the “Science and Legend” exhibition. So, are you coming with us on our Teide excursion? Then click on the following link: I want to book my Mount Teide Tour Enjoy this experience at sunset Would you like to ascend by Cable Car outside the usual hours of operation and with our staff to behold the sunset from an altitude of 3,555 m?

      "fullDescription": "\nDescription A Mount Teide Tour with cable car that has everything you need On this organised Mount Teide Tour with cable car return tickets with a digital audio guide of Mount Teide included in your booking free of change , you’ll discover Teide National Park : the most visited national park in Europe. You’ll also be visiting the park in a sustainable way. From the comfort of our bus and in the company of an official guide , you will discover scenery that will leave you wide-eyed with wonder as you ascend towards the peak. Because Tenerife is an enormous mountain in the middle of the ocean. Its roads climb to reach the heart of the island: Mount Teide. Along the way, you will pass through different bioclimatic levels. As you leave the coast, made barren by endless sunshine, the proximity of the sea and the lack of rain, you will enter the mid-altitude zone . This contains the finest agricultural land, chosen by the European settlers as the site for Tenerife’s historic towns. A series of towns is strung like a necklace at a mid altitude of between 400 and 500 metres above sea level: Arona, La Orotava, Santiago del Teide… All still conserve a historical legacy worth discovering. If your Teide excursion with a cable car ticket included takes you up the north side, the likelihood is that from 600 metres above sea level you will be engulfed by dense fog. You will be in the belt below the area of direct impact of the moist trade winds that blow in from the north-east, forming a sea of cloud . Here, laurel woods clothe the scenery in a rich green colour, and you will feel a coolness that will make you reach for your coat. Soon, at an altitude of 1,000 metres, the laurel woods give way to dense, humid pine forests, that extend up to 2,000 metres. But if your ascent takes you up the south side, where the sea of cloud struggles to form, you’ll be in the pine forest from an altitude of 600 metres. When you reach the high mountain area, you will see the sea of cloud at your feet, and you will feel as if you are flying above it. The flora of Las Cañadas comprises broom, laburnum and a vast array of other plants, most of them endemic to these peaks. Here, the extreme climate, with significant fluctuations between summer and winter, and even between day and night, determines the pattern of life. Scrub clothes the slopes of the Las Cañadas cirque, and those of Mount Teide volcano itself. But as you make your way towards the peak, it gradually disappears... Only the beautiful Teide violet survives at 3,000 metres on the volcano. And throughout your trip to Mount Teide, you will see the volcanoes that formed Tenerife, some as old as the island itself, and others more recent. Furthermore, since cable car tickets to go up Mount Teide are already included, you don’t have to worry about missing the chance to book your seat. We have thought of everything so that you can enjoy your Teide Tour without worrying about a thing! Enjoy spectacular views of Tenerife and some of the neighbouring islands on this excursion to ascend Mount Teide Our Teide Tour excursion includes tickets for the ascent and descent by cable car and, in addition, the Teide Legend digital audio guide (which features information about the volcano’s 3 open trails) to take you up to an altitude of 3,555 metres so that you can enjoy stunning views of Tenerife and some of the neighbouring islands, whilst at the same time seeing one of the world’s most extraordinary volcanic landscapes. On Las Cañadas, you will see different types of lava and volcanic rock formations, beginning with Mount Teide itself, a stratovolcano of the Vesuvian type . Mount Teide was formed gradually, as eruption followed eruption. Each eruption added another level to the volcanic edifice. Mount Teide began as a small volcanic cone at the base of Las Cañadas 150,000 years ago, and reached a height of 3,718 metres 1,000 years ago, when its most recent eruptions occurred; these formed the current peak and the streams of black lava that flow down its slopes. Now Mount Teide is the highest peak in the Atlantic region, the highest peak in Spain, and the third highest volcano on Earth measured from the sea bed, from where it reaches a height of 7,500 metres. When you reach the cable car upper station, you can choose which views you’d like to enjoy and which audio guide tracks to listen to: Admire Siete Cañadas and the Ucanca valley from La Rambleta viewpoint Follow the La Fortaleza trail and enjoy spectacular views of northern Tenerife Choose the Pico Viejo viewpoint trail and admire views of southern Tenerife with the impressive 800-m-diameter Pico Viejo crater at your feet and, if the weather permits, the islands of La Gomera, El Hierro and La Palma on the horizon.

Did you know that by choosing to visit the National Park and ascend Mount Teide by cable car on this excursion you can forget having to circle around in your car until you find a parking space? Can you imagine a better excursion than this Mount Teide Tour with cable car? We already know which will be your favourite excursion: Mount Teide Tour in Tenerife! Live the Teide Legend at the Teide “Science and Legend” exhibition! Mount Teide Tour with Cable Car Tickets includes free admission to the “Science and Legend” exhibition at the Teide Cable Car Visitors’ Centre, which is available in 8 languages thanks to the Teide Legend audio guide included in your tour, free of charge. You will learn about Mount Teide’s last major eruption (around 1,000 years ago) which the indigenous Guanches probably interpreted as a fight between mythological deities —an explanation far removed from that which science now attributes to volcanic eruptions. The characters of the legend of Guayota, both gods and humans, will show you their vision of the stages of the eruption that took place back then, and which formed the pylon at the summit of Mount Teide, known locally as “el tapón del Teide” [the Teide cap]. A magical story in which good and evil join in an epic battle. Along with the legend, you will be shown reliable data to illustrate the scientific interpretation of the eruption. Although the two perspectives may seem diametrically opposed, they are in fact closely connected. In addition, you can have a great time at our Visitors’ Centre, where you can find brilliant mementoes of your visit to the legend of the Teide National Park at our official souvenir shop . And you can relax and enjoy a culinary experience with panoramic views of the National Park in Spain’s highest restaurant and snack bar , whose badge of identity is the distinctly Canary Island character of its food and drink.",

      "fullDescription": "\nDescription An excursion to Mount Teide, available every day, where you’ll learn fascinating facts while having fun Would you like to visit Mount Teide in comfort and enjoy every second, without having to worry about parking or driving? Would you like your excursion to be more sustainable, so you help to conserve Teide National Park and prevent the mass use of vehicles in a protected natural environment? Are you interested in learning about the geography, geology, and history of the park from an official guide? Teide Tour without Cable Car is the perfect guided excursion for people who would love to find out about the most-visited national park in Europe and aren’t planning to use the cable car on their visit. It also includes the Teide Legend digital audio guide for an enriching learning experience. That’s right: get ready to see Mount Teide close-up , because one of the stops on the route is right at the base of the volcano, where you’ll find the Teide Cable Car Visitors’ Centre . But let’s take things one step at a time! At the agreed time, the group transport will collect you from the nearest pick-up point to your accommodation in the area of the island you choose: north, south, or metropolitan zone of Santa Cruz de Tenerife or Candelaria. An official guide will join you on the whole journey to Teide, where you’ll be immersed in everything related to the natural and cultural heritage of the National Park . Depending on your entrance route (which is determined by your pick-up zone), you’ll see changing plant life growing at different bioclimatic levels on the peak of Tenerife. It’s a landscape that never fails to impress! As you leave the coast behind and ascend by road, you’ll head up into the mid-altitude zone . These lands are ideal for agriculture and European colonizers chose them to build the historic towns of Tenerife. The zone has an altitude of between 400 and 500 m above sea level, and is home to important towns including Arona, La Orotava, Santiago del Teide, etc. Each one has a rich cultural heritage that is well worth discovering. If you head to Teide from the north, you may well find yourself in a deep fog once you are around 600 metres above sea level. This zone is directly impacted by the damp trade winds that blow from the north-east and produce a sea of clouds ; forests spread a lush green across the landscape and you’ll want to wrap up in the cool air. As you ascend and pass the 1,000 metres altitude point, you continue to be surrounded by the damp and dense pine forest until you reach 2,000 metres. However, if you’re travelling from the south, a sea of clouds hardly forms and you’ll see pine trees from an altitude of 600 metres. When you reach the high mountain zone, the puffy sea of clouds spreads out beneath your feet as if you were flying. Broom, laburnum and many other native species can be found among the plant life at Las Cañadas. Here, the extreme climate, which varies wildly between summer and winter, and even between day and night, sets the pace of life. Shrubs spread across the slopes of the Las Cañadas cirque and Mount Teide itself. As you approach the peak, they slowly disappear... only the delicate Teide violet can withstand life on the volcano at an altitude of 3,000 metres. During your journey on this excursion to Mount Teide, you’ll see the volcanoes that have shaped Tenerife, from the oldest ones to the youngest formations. Your guide will share fascinating facts about how the island was formed and about Teide volcano, the highest in Spain and the third highest in the world from its base on the oceanbed. You’ll make stops along the way where you’ll learn about the geography and geology of the Canary Islands archipelago. One stop is at the Roques de García where you’ll see the famous Roque Cinchado , a remarkable volcanic formation that once appeared on the back of the old 1,000 peseta bank note, together with an image of Mount Teide, a stratovolcano like Vesuvius. The Teide Legend audio guide included in your booking will provide you with information about the Roques de García trail—part of which you will be able to traverse—as well as the Montaña Majúa trail. Discover Teide National Park in a different way with Teide Legend. Did you know that Mount Teide formed gradually over time, each eruption making the volcanic structure grow larger? It has been slowly developing since it began as a small cone at the base of Las Cañadas around 150,000 years ago, growing over the years to stand 3,718 m tall after its last eruptions around 1,000 years ago. These last eruptions created the current shape of the peak and the black lava flows that wind down its slopes. Thanks to the incredible volcanic landscape in the National Park, with its variety of lava and the remarkable volcanic formations you’ll see on your stops... you may well think you’re on Mars! Make your visit to Mount Teide sustainable on this Teide Tour without Cable Car Conserving the National Park is everyone’s responsibility, which is why Volcano Teide runs tours to this incredible place in the morning and afternoon, before, during and after sunset. Contribute to the sustainability of Mount Teide by visiting the park with group transport on the daytime Teide Tour without Cable Car. By choosing this type of visit, you’ll help to prevent overcrowding in the areas used for vehicle parking inside the National Park which, as a conservation measure, are small and unsuitable for expansion. You’ll also help to reduce air pollution by using group transport. What’s more, you won’t be parking in unauthorised zones, a practice that has extremely harmful consequences for conserving the biodiversity of this protected natural space. Visit the “Science and Legend” exhibition by Teide Legend and discover the Legend of Guayota! The Teide Tour without Cable Car includes free admission to the “Science and Legend” exhibition which you will find at the Teide Cable Car Visitors’ Centre, at the foot of the Teide stratovolcano. Do you know the legend of Guayota, the demon who lives inside the volcano and whose fury was feared by the native Guanche people? The Guanches had their own interpretation of the last great eruption of Mount Teide, which occurred around 1,000 years ago . They believed it was caused by a fight between mythological gods. In the exhibition, Gods and humans tell their version of the various stages of the eruption that formed the pylon at the peak of Mount Teide, known as “el tapón del Teide” [the Teide cap]. In the Guanche version of events, good and evil fought in an epic battle. The exhibition also features a scientific explanation of the eruption to contrast with the mythological vision so you can compare both perspectives. They may appear to be total opposites, but they have a close connection. Thanks to the Teide Legend digital audio guide, which is included in your booking free of change, you can complete your visit of the exhibition listening to the audio tracks which correspond to the different information panels, in your preferred language. Download the Teide Legend audio guide app to your Android or Apple device before the tour . Use the booking code from your Teide Tour reservation to quickly and easily access the app and enjoy a contactless experience. Watch the Teide Legend audio guide video tutorial below, which we have prepared for you: Moreover, the Visitors’ Centre also has an official souvenir shop with T-shirts, caps, mugs, keyrings, etc., that are inspired by characters from the Legend of Guayota, and a fantastic souvenir comic that tells the story in full colour. Children will love the kid-friendly version of the comic with stickers! The tour of the Visitors’ Centre ends with a break to take in the best views of Teide National Park from the highest café-restaurant in Spain . Dishes have the wonderful flavour of the Canary Islands so make sure to try something while you enjoy unforgettable views of the park. We support local produce which is why products on sale in our café-restaurant are made in the Canary Islands, like Teide beer. Get ready to enjoy the Teide Tour without Cable Car guided excursion, with the Teide Legend digital audio guide included, and spend a few magical hours in a protected natural space that looks like it’s from another world!",

      "fullDescription": "\nDescription The Teide sunset with the Cable Car for your private use. Imagine climbing the skies, 3,555m high, in an exclusive cable car, which isn’t accessible by the general public. Imagine experiencing the impressive Tenerife sunset on the Cable Car at Sunset tour, where you can fly above craters and lava flows as the sun sets at the highest point of Spain. Furthermore, the Teide Sunset Tour will make you feel really special and privileged. Because the Teide Cable Car at sunset will operate exclusively for your private group. Enjoy the best Tenerife sunset! >The creatures that live in the National Park are also unique. Of the almost 200 plant species found here, over 50 are endemic to the Canary archipelago , around thirty are endemic to Tenerife, and 13 can only be found on Tenerife’s mountain heights. They are endemic to a particular locality; in other words, if you want to see them, you’ll need to go up to Las Cañadas del Teide. Some are very rare and scarce, while the survival of others is in peril. And they have evocative names, such as red bugloss or tower-of-jewels, broom, silver thistle, St. John’s wort, or the Teide violet. And the scientific community, while it may think it knows them all, can still be surprised by the Teide National Park, as new species continue to be found—such as the recently discovered Guajara violet, a plant that can only be found on that particular mountain. Your friends will be amazed by the photographs of Mount Teide and its views at this time of day, which you won’t stop sharing on your social networks! Watching the Teide sunset is a magical experience! Tenerife sunset in the shadow of the volcano with the Teide Cable Car You feel special and privileged at the highest point in Spain when you travel by cable car to see the sunset from Mount Teide. As soon as you arrive at the cable car upper station (at La Rambleta, Mount Teide’s penultimate crater, at an altitude of 3,000 metres), you will have at your feet the Las Cañadas caldera, a massive natural amphitheatre. It is one of the largest volcanic calderas in the world, with a perimeter of 45 kilometres stretching from east to west, forming a semicircle of escarpments and slopes, and crowned by the Guajara mountain, which rises to a height of 2,715 metres. The light from the setting sun highlights the shadows and quirky shapes of the Las Cañadas cirque , the old foothills of the huge volcano that millions of years ago crowned the peaks of Tenerife. The magical light also accentuates the shapes of the volcanic cones and the lava flows that cover the floor of the caldera. Sunset on Mount Teide will help you to better appreciate the lava channels that descend from the peak of the volcano, the blankets of pumice that clothe Montaña Blanca, and the enormous blocks of stone in the Valle de Las Piedras Arrancadas [Valley of Torn-out Stones], where the obsidian glows in the last rays of sunshine. But Mount Teide is a thousand metres higher than the peaks of the Las Cañadas cirque, leaving the horizon clear when viewed from this gigantic volcano. As the sun sinks, Mount Teide casts its shadow, first over the Las Cañadas caldera, and then extending over the Atlantic Ocean. As if you were looking at parallel railway tracks, the shadow projects into the distance, drawing a perfect triangle of shade that stretches as far as the neighbouring island of Gran Canaria. Few places in the world can offer a natural spectacle on this scale. This is why long after the end of the Teide Sunset Tour you will still remember the spectacle of Teide’s shadow cast towards the island of Gran Canaria. It’s one of the most beautiful and spectacular moments that the volcano offers its visitors! An unforgettable sunset in Tenerife with the Teide Cable Car The Teide Cable Car at sunset activity includes access to the spectacular Pico Viejo viewpoint trail. This trail is a wonder in itself! Because from the Pico Viejo trail, you will have the opportunity to see, in the distance, part of the lava poured during the eruptive process that took place on Mount Teide in 1798 and lasted three months! The eruption of 1798 formed the “Teide’s Nostrils” or “Las Narices del Teide”, the craters which spewed out lava during that historical eruption and which are located on the western slopes of Pico Viejo. On the Mount Teide Sunset Tour, you will behold all of the volcanic wonders that surround this impressive Pico Viejo viewpoint trail. The trail and the surrounding scenery acquire a truly remarkable array of colours at sunset, which are unforgettable to visitors. If the weather permits, you will experience a unique view over the neighbouring islands of La Gomera, El Hierro and La Palma on the horizon, with the impressive Pico Viejo crater at your feet, which is 800 m in diameter and at one time, hosted an impressive lava lake. The Teide sunset is truly unique and unforgettable! Complete your Teide Sunset Tour with an astronomical observation at the foot of the volcano If you already know that you won’t want the evening to end after living this volcanic experience, and if the stars, constellations, planets and the entire Universe fascinate you, with our proposal, you will conduct observations of the night sky using long range telescopes and enjoy the explanations, provided by our Starlight guides, of the starry sky over Mount Teide, from where it is possible to see 83 of the 88 existing constellations. There is a Sunset & Stars (Sunset and Stars on Teide) waiting for you.",

Feel the excitement of watching the Teide sunset from the highest peak in Spain with the cable car at sunset and observe the Tenerife stars on Teide under one of the top-quality starry skies in the world. Enjoy our guided Mount Teide by night excursion which offers you a sunset view followed by a stargazing experience in Tenerife You don’t need a car to visit Mount Teide by night . On this Sunset and Stars Teide Tour with astronomical observation you will ascend comfortably to 3,555 m and enjoy both the spectacle of Teide’s shadow cast towards the horizon over the island of Gran Canaria, as well as Spain’s highest sunset from the trail to the Pico Viejo viewpoint , with this volcano’s impressive 800-m-diameter crater at your feet and views over some of the neighbouring islands, such as La Gomera, El Hierro and La Palma, if the weather permits. On this Sunset and Stars - Mount Teide Sunset Tour you won’t stop sharing on your social networks the photographs of what would probably be one of the best sunsets you have ever seen! With the assistance of our guides, you will discover all of the volcanic wonders that surround the impressive trail to the Pico Viejo viewpoint . The trail and the surrounding scenery acquire a truly remarkable array of colours at sunset, which are unforgettable to visitors. Because sunset is when you can best read the open book of the geological history of this volcanic island, formed by very many volcanic episodes over time. That explains why Mount Teide is a stratovolcano, which was built up by various eruptions over hundreds of thousands of years. The evening light brings out the shapes, textures and colours of the black rivers of lava that flowed down from the crater, so that you can better appreciate the accretionary lava balls and the high-walled lava channels. The trail begins on La Corbata, a whitish rock formation, and continues westwards with the amphitheatre of the Las Cañadas cirque a constant backdrop to this astounding landscape. At the end lies the remarkable crater of Pico Viejo, another immense volcano that crowns the Abeque ridge, a barren ‘malpaís’ strewn with recent lava fields and volcanic cones, many of them historic; the most notable of these is the Chinyero volcano, the site of Tenerife’s most recent eruption in 1909. In the distance rises the Teno massif, which is much older than either Las Cañadas or Mount Teide, and out on the ocean, the islands of La Palma and La Gomera can be seen, with El Hierro further back on the horizon. After the sunset and just before starting your Mount Teide stargazing experience, you will have time to enjoy a dinner of your choice . Look up to the sky and enjoy Mount Teide stargazing in one of the best starry skies in the world When you think it’s not possible to feel more excited, you will be astounded by the spectacle of the sky over Mount Teide which you will behold from the Teide cable car base station’s car park. But you will be prepared! During the astronomical observation included in this guided Sunset and Stars - Mount Teide by Night Tour , our Starlight guides will unravel for you the mysteries of the sky over Mt Teide, one of the three best skies on the planet, along with Chile and Hawaii, where it is possible to see 83 out of the 88 officially recognised constellations. Observe this spectacle on Mount Teide stargazing with the unaided eye and using our professional telescopes, learn how to guide yourself thanks to the sky and enjoy discerning the elements of Greek mythology, which are hidden behind the constellations. Thanks to our professional state-of-the-art telescopes, which you will have at your disposal during the astronomical observation on this Teide Sunset Tour , you will discover planets, galaxies and clusters as you have surely never seen before, and you will go through the most interesting celestial objects of every night. You can be sure that the professional astronomical instrumentation , along with the quality and transparency of the sky over Mt Teide, will give you a unique Mount Teide stargazing experience. Mount Teide Stargazing Tour: astronomical observation on a full moon night As you already know, the moon passes through different phases during its 29-day cycle, that is to say, lunation. Therefore, at least once a month, its potent glow will dim the faint light of the distant stars. If you take your Mount Teide Stars Tour on the night of the full moon, you will take advantage of its radiant appearance and be delighted with its splendour: mountain ranges, craters and other lunar wonders . If you haven’t known that you can find the Montes Teneriffe, Mons Pico and the crater Piazzi Smyth on the Moon, ask our Mount Teide Stargazing Tour guides where they are located and why they have these names.",

      "fullDescription": "\nDescription Make your dream a reality and enjoy the Universe in a professional way in one of the best places for a stargazing experience in Tenerife: on Mount Teide. The history of the Teide astronomical observatory began in 1856, when the Titania set sail from England and arrived in Tenerife. On board were the astronomer Charles Piazzi Smyth and a cargo of instruments for astronomical observation. Smyth undertook a scientific expedition to the mountain peaks of Tenerife, climbing above the clouds to spend 63 days on Mount Teide and Mount Guajara setting up astronomical observatories on both peaks. He set up his bases for observing the stars high on the mountains—to take advantage of the climate and the clarity of the sky above Las Cañadas. On the day of his departure from the island, he wrote that he wondered “how long the enlightened world would wait before establishing a station there with the potential to contribute so much to the advance of this most sublime of the Sciences”. A hundred years later, his dream would come true with the setting up of the Teide Observatory , one of the finest observatories in the world. Laying claim to the legacy of Piazzi Smyth, certified astronomical guides will wait for you during this Mount Teide stargazing experience to unravel the mysteries of the Universe for you using professional telescopes, which will allow you to see up close and for your own eyes those fascinating celestial objects that you have longed to see for many years, under the pure and clear sky of the Teide National Park, where it is possible to observe 83 of the 88 officially recognised constellations and where, in the summertime, you can enjoy perfect visibility of the Milky Way. A fascinating stargazing experience in Tenerife to enjoy the most starry side of Mount Teide Have you always wondered what star or celestial object is that shiny point, either big or small, that you can see in the sky? Our Starlight guides will clear all your doubts as they will be there to unravel the mysteries of the Universe for you during this stargazing experience on Teide by night. Do you find it fascinating that ancient civilisations oriented themselves using the stars? Have you always wanted to be able to do it as well? But as the stars cannot be seen in the daytime, the mariners of old still needed the sun and geographical landmarks to orientate themselves and to plot their course. For centuries, sailors who ventured out to sea used Mount Teide as one of their landmarks. It was known as the lighthouse of the Atlantic, as it could be seen on the horizon from many miles away and so became a reference point for navigation. The strange thing is that back then, when the Phoenician and Roman sailors, and later the Europeans, used Mount Teide as a lighthouse, it appears that the Guanches (the original inhabitants of Tenerife) knew nothing of navigation. To them, Mount Teide, or Echeyde as they called it, was the dwelling-place of fire. In pre-Hispanic times, Las Cañadas and Mount Teide were a communal territory not ruled by any of the Guanche kingdoms, or Menceyatos , that made up Tenerife. The Guanches were shepherds, and they used the high mountain peaks as communal grazing land during the summer, when pasture was scarce at lower altitudes. They would live on the mountains with their flocks, and then when the weather turned colder, they would gather their flocks and bring them down again. A large number of archaeological sites across the National Park show evidence of human presence in those times. The Guanches used the mouths of volcanic tunnels, caves and hollows as dwellings, and even as burial tombs where they laid the mummies of their dead. But at night there are stars... Lots of them. Our guides will show you how to guide yourself thanks to the sky . Furthermore, if Greek mythology and constellations have always been your passions, during this stargazing experience on Teide you will enjoy discerning the elements of Hellenic mythology, which are hidden behind the constellations and the relationship between them. Use our state-of-the-art telescopes to discover planets, galaxies or clusters as you have always dreamt of doing, and stargaze in one of the three best places on Earth to do it. Not only will you be able to use these machines during this stargazing experience on Teide by night to take a tour through the night’s most interesting celestial objects but also our monitors will provide you with relevant information about the objects that you will see through the lens. Get closer to the stars with the professional telescopes on your Teide Astronomical Tour This stargazing experience on Teide by night lets you observe the clear, starry sky from the car park of the cable car base station (at an altitude of 2,536 m), using long-range, professional telescopes . We are sure that the astronomical instrumentation that you will have at your disposal during this stargazing experience on Teide by night, along with the quality and transparency of the sky over the Teide National Park in Tenerife, away from the light pollution produced by big cities, will give you a unique experience, which will feel as if you’re close to the stars . Mount Teide stargazing experience in Tenerife also on full moon nights It’s inevitable. The moon passes through different phases during its 29-day cycle, that is to say, lunation. This is why, at least once a month, the potent glow of the Earth’s natural satellite will dim the faint light of the distant celestial bodies. If you book our astronomical observation on Teide and enjoy it on the night of the full moon, you will take advantage of its radiant appearance and be delighted with its splendour: craters, mountain ranges and other lunar wonders . You may ask, which ones? You can find the Montes Teneriffe, Mons Pico and the crater Piazzi Smyth on the moon. If this is news to you, and you’re wondering why they have these names, write this question down so that you can ask our guides on the night of your stargazing experience in Tenerife.",

Are you looking to finally have the unique and amazing experience that your friends who have already done it been telling you about? Climbing Mount Teide is a once-in-a-lifetime experience which you simply cannot miss on your Tenerife holiday. With our Mount Teide Tour with Cable Car you can realise your 3,715 m high dream . By using the cable car, followed by a walk lasting around one hour, you can journey back through the last thousand years of this volcano’s history. The cable car upper station is at Mount Teide’s penultimate crater, La Rambleta, which has a far larger diameter than the current crater. But a thousand years ago, the volcano began to roar, and increased its height to 3,715 metres. That is when the current Pico del Teide was formed. This eruption also caused the streams of black lava that flow down its sides. When you arrive at the crater, the feeling of being on Mars is even stronger. At your feet lies the island of Tenerife and, on the horizon but seemingly so close that you could touch them, are the islands of Gran Canaria, El Hierro, La Gomera, and La Palma. The smell of sulphur is everywhere, and the heat given off by the vents makes you imagine that Guayota —the evil one who lived here, according to the ancient Guanches—lives on and is still hiding in some volcanic cavern... But they do say he is in a deep, deep sleep! Conquer Mount Teide summit and live your dream Dreams are only dreams up until the point when you suddenly make them come true. Make your dreams a reality by climbing Mount Teide up to the highest point in Spain without worrying about applying for the permit to access the Teide Crater because it is already included in the Mount Teide Tour with Cable Car, so that you can reach the Teide Crater and enjoy the sensational views at 3,715 m high without worrying about a thing*! Feel the mix of sensations that only conquering the Teide summit can give hiking enthusiasts and nature lovers—adrenaline, personal accomplishment and physical and mental control. Climbing Mount Teide on our Teide Peak Tour is an adventure! Achieve your desire of climbing Mount Teide with comfort in our cable cars This Mount Teide Tour with Cable Car is perfect if you are short of time or energy to embark on this adventure from the starting point of the trail at Montaña Blanca. Use the Teide cable car to cover the 1,199 m ascent from the base to the upper station, situated at an altitude of 3,555 m, which marks the spot of the start of Teide National Park’s thrilling hiking route Nr. 10, the Telesforo Bravo trail , christened thus in honour of the famous Canary Island volcanologist. This trail will bring you to the impressive Teide Crater for you all to enjoy one of the world’s most spectacular landscapes. Remember that you need a permit for climbing Mount Teide—a permit to ascend to the Peak of Teide. This is included in our Teide Peak Tour. Live the Teide Legend at the Teide “Science and Legend” exhibition! The excursion “Climbing the Teide Crater with the help of the Cable Car” includes free admission to the “Science and Legend” exhibition which you will find at the Teide Cable Car Visitors’ Centre. You will learn about Mount Teide’s last major eruption (around 1,000 years ago) which the indigenous Guanches probably interpreted as a fight between mythological deities —an explanation far removed from that which science now attributes to volcanic eruptions. The characters of the legend of Guayota, both gods and humans, will show you their vision of the stages of the eruption that took place back then, and which formed the pylon at the summit of Mount Teide, known locally as “el tapón del Teide” [the Teide cap]. A magical story in which good and evil join in an epic battle. Along with the legend, you will be shown reliable data to illustrate the scientific interpretation of the eruption. Although the two perspectives may seem diametrically opposed, they are in fact closely connected.

      "fullDescription": "\nDescription Experience the scientific side of Tenerife with a Teide Observatory visit There’s so much more to Tenerife than the sun and the beach. Inland, almost half of the island lies within the Canary Islands’ Network of Protected Natural Spaces, and a good proportion also belongs to the Natura 2000 Network, which aims to ensure the long-term survival of Europe’s most threatened species and habitats. That may give you a clue as to the environmental importance and richness of Tenerife. The island holds several international awards from UNESCO to attest to its natural and cultural wealth. The Teide National Park has been declared a World Heritage Site , as has the city of San Cristóbal de La Laguna, while the Macizo de Anaga is a World Biosphere Reserve. The island is volcanoes, sea, sky, forests, historic towns and cities, and more. Its natural treasures and its culture make it a first-class scientific laboratory. Discover it on your visit to the Teide Observatory! You must already know that the Canary Islands are one of the three best spots in the world to observe the sky, along with Chile and Hawaii, which is why the Tenerife Observatory is the largest solar observatory in the world . The latitude on which the Canary archipelago lies, the altitude of the islands above the sea of cloud and a sky at this height which is always clear, due to the trade winds, explains why we are one of the three most important observatories in the world. The Teide Observatory came into operation in 1964, a century after the English astronomer Piazzi Smyth visited Tenerife on a scientific expedition in search of the best high-mountain skies for an astronomical observatory. Smyth can be considered a pioneer of modern astronomy, as well as the founder of the Teide Observatory, as he was the first to set up two observatories (one on Mount Teide and another on Mount Guajara) during the course of that 1856 expedition. The Teide Observatory dedicates its scientific work to solar observation and robotic astronomy. It has a large number of solar and night telescopes belonging to various European countries. What you probably don’t know, yet, is that the researchers who work at the Tenerife Observatory make great contributions to the field of science, with an average of one publication per day. And did you know that the discovery of the Sun having its own frequency and beating like a heart every five minutes was made at the Tenerife Observatory? Book your ticket today, to visit the Teide Observatory with us, to discover this spectacular scientific centre during the day, and to get to know the Tenerife Observatory and the activities of the researchers who work there, in an enjoyable way. Our guides will make you feel like a scientist for a day as during this Tenerife Observatory visit: You will be introduced to the importance of the sky in the Canary Islands , the Teide Observatory telescopes and the different projects of the Canary Islands Institute of Astrophysics , the institution that manages this solar observatory. You will participate in a workshop on astrophysics given at the visitors’ centre, in which our guides will explain what astrophysics is and how astrophysicists work. You will observe sunspots and solar flares through two solar telescopes, which you will have at your disposal to fully enjoy them. You will explore the inside of a nocturnal telescope and won’t leave until you know how it functions and learn about its exciting history. You can also visit the Tenerife Observatory with other activities which include a tour of the Teide Observatory .",

      "fullDescription": "\nDescription Enjoy this 2-in-1 Astronomic Tour of Teide for astronomy lovers in Tenerife The Astronomic Tour of Teide is our 2-in-1 Teide astronomical tour, which combines a daytime visit of Tenerife Observatory (a night tour of Teide Observatory is not available) with a stargazing experience . Transport is also offered for the Teide Astronomical Tour from various points on the island of Tenerife. Please note that the facilities of this scientific centre aren’t open for a Teide Observatory night tour. On this astronomic tour in Tenerife, you will visit Izaña Observatory during the daytime. During this Astronomic Tour to Teide, which lasts approximately 8 hours, our Starlight guide accompanies you at all times, so that you can enjoy Mt Teide by night . But you’ll also be accompanied by nocturnal creatures. As the sun goes down, a change comes over the National Park. Creatures that are active during the daytime hide away, and the nocturnal creatures emerge from their lairs. Many invertebrates start scampering among the plants, and the harmless bats abandon the volcanic tunnels, cracks and caves where they spend the hours of daylight asleep, to make themselves lords and masters of the scrubland as they hunt for moths. The National Park is home to five of the seven species of bat that inhabit the Canary archipelago. Especially noteworthy are the Canary long-eared bat and the free-tailed bat (Tadarida teniotis), the largest bat to be found on these islands. Your Astronomic Tour of Teide includes a visit of the Teide Observatory—in the afternoon and with a guide, because Teide Observatory isn’t open to visitors at night. Once the sun has gone down, you will enjoy a stargazing experience using long-range telescopes at 2,356 m at the Teide Cable Car base station, under the clear and pure sky of the Teide National Park, the most visited national park in Europe. This astronomic tour in Tenerife also includes a stop for a meal. You choose whether you prefer to bring your own food or buy our optional picnic-style dinner along with your ‘Astronomic Tour including a visit of Teide Observatory’. An afternoon Teide Observatory tour Tenerife is so much more than just sun and beaches. The island is also famous for science, its volcanoes and the stars over Mt Teide. The Canary Islands are one of the three best spots on Earth to observe the sky. The other two spots, just for curiosity’s sake, are Chile and Hawaii. This is why we are fortunate to have the most important solar observatory here in Tenerife. Some people feel they would prefer to discover Teide Observatory on a night tour but there is a very good reason it is only open to visitors during the daytime; during the night, a team of scientists works at Teide Observatory to perform research work into the night skies. Did you know that the Teide Observatory began to operate in 1964 and focuses on solar observations and robotic astronomy? Moreover, it is home to a wide range of solar and nocturnal telescopes, owned by different European countries. Thanks to the guides on your Astronomic Tour of Teide, you can feel like a scientist for a day as during the afternoon Tenerife Observatory visit: You’re introduced to astronomy in Tenerife and the importance of the sky in the Canary Islands , the Teide Observatory telescopes and the different projects of the Canary Islands Institute of Astrophysics, also known as IAC . You participate in the most interesting astrophysics workshop, held in the Teide Observatory visitors centre, shared with you by our Starlight guides, where we explain what astrophysics is and how the astrophysicists in this centre conduct their research. You enjoy the sun like never before whilst observing sunspots and solar flares through two solar telescopes that we make available to you. You visit the inside of a nocturnal telescope and don’t leave until you know how it functions and learn about its exciting history. Mount Teide Astronomical Tour to enjoy astronomy in Tenerife After the Tenerife Observatory tour, what’s better than to enjoy the colours of the National Park when it’s getting dark, before beginning the astronomical observation, included in your stargazing night on Mount Teide. It doesn’t matter if you have already been to Teide during the day because the moment the National Park is bathed in the lovely colours of the twilight, you will feel as though you have never been in this beautiful location. Before you arrive at the Teide Observatory, you will have toured a good part of the National Park. During your tour, you will see inside the caldera of Las Cañadas , a massive volcanic formation whose origins date back 180,000 years—to when the volcano that then stood at the highest point on Tenerife collapsed and its northern slope fell away. A good proportion of the millions of tons of rock that made up the volcano slid away downwards, into the depths of the Atlantic Ocean. What remained standing of the volcanic edifice is the cirque of Las Cañadas, an oval, natural amphitheatre, which forms a wall stretching from east to west in the south of the Park. Volcanic activity soon resumed in the great tunnel that the slippage left in its wake, and successive eruptions filled Las Cañadas with lava flows. Evidence of this activity can be seen in the occasional (now dormant) volcanic cones scattered around. One of the volcanoes that emerged following the collapse was Mount Teide, which rises up in the centre of the caldera, reaching a height of 3,718 m. To date, the last eruption to have occurred in this spectacular volcanic landscape took place in 1798 at the base of Pico Viejo. A stargazing experience on Mount Teide to unravel the mysteries of the starry sky It is often said that Tenerife is a fortunate island for its climate. But it is fortunate for more reasons than this. For example: from Mount Teide, it is possible to observe 83 of the 88 officially recognised constellations. You may ask, how is it possible to see so many constellations from Mount Teide? Because there is nothing like the peaks of this friendly island to observe the stars and enjoy astronomy in Tenerife . It is also because the Teide is the best place in Tenerife to conduct an astronomical observation, away from the light pollution produced by the urban areas of the island. With the Astronomic Tour of Teide guides, you discover the secrets of the heavens from Teide National Park. You learn how to orient yourself using celestial objects and enjoy discerning the elements of Greek mythology, which are hidden behind the constellations, and the relationship between them. Get closer to the stars with the professional telescopes on your Teide Astronomical Tour The astronomical observation included in the Astronomic Tour of Teide is held in the car park next to the Teide Cable Car base station, an outstanding spot where you can let your love of astronomy loose in Tenerife. You discover planets, galaxies and clusters like you never would have imagined, thanks to our professional, last generation long range telescopes, which you have at your disposal to go through the most interesting celestial objects of every night, visible from Mount Teide. In addition, during your Astronomic Tour of Teide the guides will provide you with interesting information about the objects you observe through the telescope. Our professional astronomic instrumentation, together with the transparency and quality of the skies over the peaks of Tenerife, will without a doubt contribute to a unique experience which you will live during this astronomical tourism activity in Tenerife. Full moon astronomical observation You will already know that the moon passes through different phases during its 29-day cycle, that is to say, lunation. Therefore, at least once a month, the potent glow of our planet’s satellite will dim the faint light of the distant celestial bodies. If you book our Astronomic Tour of Teide and enjoy it on the night of the full moon, you will take advantage of its radiant appearance and be delighted with its splendour: craters, mountain ranges and other lunar wonders. To get you started: Did you know that you can find the Montes Teneriffe, Mons Pico and the crater Piazzi Smyth on the moon? If what we have just mentioned has surprised you and we have left you curious as to why they have these names, write this question down so that you can ask our guides on the night of your Astronomic Tour with a Teide Observatory visit (not including a Tenerife Observatory night tour, i.e. a night-time visit to Izaña Observatory) and with a professional observation of the Universe from the Teide cable car facilities. Book your Teide Astronomical Tour today and enjoy astronomy in Tenerife during your holiday on the island!",

      "fullDescription": "\nDescription Visit the Teide National Park with Teide Legend, and discover the legend of Guayota TEIDE LEGEND is a fun, new way to get to know the Teide National Park (and its legendary history). The birth of the legend of Mount Teide For thousands of years, the volcano, an emblem of the island of Tenerife, has been the subject of a plethora of legends passed down from one generation to the next. One of the most famous legends concerns the eruption of Mount Teide around 1,000 years ago. Back then, the Guanches, the island’s earliest inhabitants, witnessed one of the most significant events in the history of the Canary Archipelago. Mount Teide began to emit a thundering roar while lava coursed down the sides of the volcano, completely transforming the area and the mountain that was worshipped by the population. The Guanches probably interpreted this event as a fight between mythological deities—an explanation far from that which science now attributes to volcanic eruptions. This legend is deeply rooted in the minds of Canary islanders and today, we would like you to become part of it by visiting the ‘Science and Legend’ exhibition in the Teide Cable Car Visitors’ Centre , where we bring together both the mythological and the scientific perspectives. Visit the domain of Guayota! VISIT THE ‘SCIENCE AND LEGEND’ EXHIBITION In the ‘Science and Legend’ exhibition , which is housed in an impressive setting, the characters of the legend of Guayota, the gods and the Guanches, put forward their version of the volcanological events that resulted in the great eruption of Mount Teide a thousand years ago, in opposition to the scientific explanation of the various stages of the eruption. Discover the ‘Science and Legend’ Exhibition with Guayota, the demon of Mount Teide. Relive the experience of that eruption, 1,000 years ago, from the perspective of science and from that of the legend, comparing the various phases of the eruption from two apparently opposing, but closely connected, perspectives. You will have access to trusted data and at the same time, you will discover the magic of a story in which good and evil confront each other in an epic battle . Which explanation do you prefer? Are you on the side of science or on the side of legend? This action-packed story is brought to you by its own characters: Guayota, Achamán and Magec, the gods; and the Guanches: Tassat, the Mencey and the Guañameñe. Gods and humans in the most epic legend about Mount Teide . The characters of the Teide Legend. From left to right: Achamán, Tassat, Guayota and Magec. Did you know that the Guanches mummified their dead? Several Guanche mummies have been discovered in the Teide National Park, and you’ll see a replica of one of them in the exhibition! We will explain the process they undertook to preserve the dead. We have great news for you if you’re travelling with children: admission to the exhibition is free for children up to the age of 13.

      "fullDescription": "\nDescription An excursion to Mount Teide by night that you’ll find fascinating Much has been said about the spectacular landscape of the Teide National Park, but the transformation it undergoes when the sun sets is rarely mentioned. Our Mount Teide Night Tour wants to show you exactly that: the array of colours that adds beauty to the horizon at sunset and dyes the sky dark to expose 83 of the 88 constellations known to man . On your way up to visit Mount Teide by night, you will see how the plant life changes with the increasing altitude. The transformation in the landscape as you ascend is truly astonishing—you will feel as if you have crossed several continents in a journey of no more than one or two hours. Depending on the route you follow on your Mount Teide Night Tour, you will cross rural landscapes, laurel woods and pine forests. On Las Cañadas, you will find types of broom, laburnum, rosalillo de cumbre (Pterocephalus lasiospermus), and flixweed—just a few of the plants that thrive most prolifically on Tenerife’s high scrublands. If you’re in luck, you will see tiny, harmless bats fluttering around you as the sun sets. These winged mammals have spent the day hiding in the National Park’s underground network of volcanic tunnels. The volcanic tunnels are the channels through which lava once flowed , and they are the kingdom of the troglofauna . These small invertebrates are mostly blind as they live in complete darkness, but their other sensory organs have developed great sensitivity, so they have exceptional sense of smell, touch or hearing. The majority of them are endemic to Las Cañadas, and a few are found exclusively in one particular volcanic tunnel, and nowhere else in the entire world. Please remember that night hiking activities on Teide are not possible on this excursion. If you would like to do a hike, choose one of our day excursions that include hiking routes . See hiking excursions on Mount Teide So, can you ascend Teide at night? Well, that depends on what you mean by ascending Teide at night. Yes, you can ascend Teide and go stargazing from the cable car base station, an experience that is included in the “Teide at night” excursion. However, please bear in mind that this night tour to Mount Teide does not use the cable car to ascend Teide and reach the trails at the top station. What if you want to see the stars from Mount Teide by night, and also ascend to 3,555 m at sunset? Then our exclusive Sunset & Stars night excursion is just what you’re looking for! Sunset & Stars gives you the chance to ascend Teide by cable car, outside of its normal opening times. You will travel in a small group to watch an unforgettable sunset and see the giant, 3,718-m-high volcano cast its pyramid-shaped shadow across the sea. You’ll enjoy visiting La Rambleta, at an altitude of 3,555 m, and watch a spectacular sunset from the trail to Pico Viejo Viewpoint, a spot with breathtaking views. And that’s not all—after this exceptional experience, you will then go stargazing from the base station. What’s more, the excursion includes a picnic-style dinner of Canary Islands food. I want the Sunset & Stars with night hiking on Mount Teide If you would like to find out about more excursions to Mount Teide by night and view the prices for these experiences, please check all our stargazing excursions. A Mount Teide Night Tour with sunset and astronomical observation to visit Mount Teide by night Before you begin your “Teide at night” stargazing experience, you will have toured a good part of the National Park and, from some impressive viewing point you will have seen a sunset that will remain in your memory for many years to come . In the dying light, the volcanic landscape takes on colours and hues of the utmost beauty. The spectacular, oval Las Cañadas caldera (one of the biggest volcanic calderas in the world with a perimeter of 45 km) spreads out before your eyes. In its centre stands Mount Teide volcano, an immense stratovolcano, rising to 3,718 m. Everywhere you look, you will see all kinds of lava deposits clothing large areas of the caldera, the product of eruptions stretching back over thousands of years. During your tour, you will see rounded volcanic cones covered in pumice stone, others covered in charcoal and ash, some turned black or a reddish colour by oxidisation, tongues of lava that hang from the sides of the volcanoes, and huge blocks of stone (in which you can see traces of gleaming obsidian) strewn haphazardly around. To tour Las Cañadas del Teide at night, before your exploration of the planets and galaxies, is to take a geological journey back over 180,000 years in one of Earth’s most remarkable volcanic landscapes. And if there happens to be a full moon, you will discover the most amazing lunar landscape. It’s a “Teide at night” experience that has it all! You’ll be pleased to know that this excursion to Teide at night also includes a stop for dinner. You can choose whether to bring your own snacks, or to book the Mount Teide Night Tour with a picnic included. Is there any better way to visit Mount Teide by night than on this night excursion to Teide that includes ascending Teide at night to the cable car base station at Las Cañadas del Teide, at an altitude of 2,356 m? And once there, seeing the stars in one of the best skies in the world for astronomy?",

      "content": "1. Map of the best places to see on Mount Teide\nThe map below shows the places to see in the Teide National Park . Most of these can be reached via the TF-21, the road that crosses Las Cañadas del Teide, although there are other attractions that require a short walk if you want to enjoy the full splendour of this volcanic landscape.\n\n2. The Teide National Park\n- Directions.\nThe Teide National Park is the Canary Islands’ largest National Park, an excursion that no visitor to Tenerife should miss. In this natural park, you will find unique landscapes around the impressive silhouette formed by the volcano, which towers to an altitude of 3,718 metres.\nAnyone asking about what to see on Mount Teide , must also ask what there is to see near Mount Teide , as this is an extraordinary geological treasure featuring volcanoes, craters, chimneys and lava streams, making for a remarkable panorama of colours and shapes.\nLas Cañadas del Teide can surprise visitors with their diversity, and impress them with the rocks ravaged by erosion, and by the vast dimensions of this chaotic mineral landscape.\nThe dominant structure is Mount Teide, from which the National Park takes its name, an imposing volcanic edifice that can bee seen from much of the island, and especially from the whole of the northern coast, which it watches over with its thousand faces. The view can be very different, depending on the season and the time of day. At the feet of the volcano, there lies a stretch of volcanic rocks so recent that they do not yet show the effects of erosion; they present a vast assortment of volcanic shapes and materials within the huge amphitheatre framed by the wall of Las Cañadas. This imposing wall stretches for 25 kilometres, and reaches heights of up to 600 metres at its highest points in the area known as Guajara.\nStunning image of Las Cañadas del Teide\nThis geological park , declared a National Park in 1954, offers many services and benefits for visitors: from convenient access by road, visitors’ centres and restaurant facilities, to spectacular viewing points, an extensive network of paths, and even two establishments providing accommodation—the Parador Nacional de Las Cañadas del Teide and the Altavista Mountain Refuge , which stands at an altitude of 3,270 metres.\nThe Teide National Park was declared a World Heritage site by UNESCO in 2007 .\n\n3. What to see on Mount Teide\nAs you might expect, this National Park offers many and very varied attractions. For this reason, it’s a good idea to know what you want to see on your visit to Mount Teide , whether you visit independently or on an excursion, although on an excursion your only task will be to go with the flow and enjoy the experience.\nRoques de García\n— 4.5 km from the Teide Cable Car.\nWithout doubt, one of the Park’s most famous and photographed rock formations. These rocks are situated opposite the Parador del Turismo, and are very popular with the public thanks to their iconic beauty, and for the view they afford of the volcano.\nThese rocks rise up from the Llano de Ucanca plain, and there are a couple of paths you can follow to see their glory from all angles. Among the outstanding formations are La Catetral and La Cascada, but the most famous of all is the Roque Cinchado, which gained its fame when it appeared on the 1,000 peseta note that also featured Benito Pérez Galdós.\nLos Roques de García in the Teide National Park\nArenas Negras\n— 11.1 km from the Teide Cable Car.\nArenas Negras [Black Sands] is a path that starts at the El Portillo Visitors’ Centre, and climbs the broom-clad Montaña del Cerrillar, reaching an altitude that allows visitors to enjoy a beautiful view of the Park and of the Llano de Maja. On very clear days, it is possible to see the silhouette of La Palma in the distance. This is definitely a good choice for visitors wondering what to see near Mount Teide . In fact, from there it is more than likely that you will be able to see the sea of clouds that forms in the north of the island.\nArenas Negras in the Teide National Park\nEl Portillo Visitors’ Centre\n— 11.1 km from the Teide Cable Car.\nIf you intend using the Arenas Negras path, we strongly recommend that you access the visitors’ centre and immerse yourself in the history of the Teide National Park since the formation of the Canary Islands.\nIn addition, the centre has an exhibition room, a passage that replicates a volcanic tunnel, and a large-scale model of Tenerife.\nOne important feature of the El Portillo Visitors’ Centre is that it is perfectly integrated into the volcanic landscape. The Centre also has a Botanical Garden, where you can see over 75% of the Park’s plant species, including its famous tajinastes or ‘tower-of-jewels’ ( Echium wildpretii ) plants.\nEl Portillo Visitors’ Centre in the Teide National Park\nTeide astronomical observatory\n— 18.3 km from the Teide Cable Car.\nAstronomy enthusiasts will have the time of their lives in Tenerife, as the Teide National Park is home to the Teide Observatory. This has advanced telescopes which, according to the Canary Islands Institute of Astrophysics, have enabled us to “ track the most significant comets of recent years (including the collision between the P/Shoemaker-Levy comet and Jupiter), and to obtain a large-scale map of the centre of the Milky Way ”.\nTeide Observatory facilities in the National Park\nThat is why this is the world’s biggest solar observatory, located at one of the best sites on Earth for observing the universe.\nFortunately, this is not somewhere that is closed to the public, as there are excursions and tours to the Teide Observatory , where visitors can immerse themselves in all the astronomical wisdom that lies within.\nMount Teide viewing points\nAs might be expected when one considers the majesty of the volcano, when compiling a list of places to see near Mount Teide , it is essential to mention the main miradores [viewing points] to be found at different points in the National Park.\nMirador Zapatilla de la Reina\n— 8.4 km from the Teide Cable Car.\nAs a result of erosion over thousands of years, a formation has evolved in the shape of a heeled shoe (at least according to popular imagination). It is located in the south of the National Park, and offers a somewhat unusual perspective of the volcanic cone.\nMirador de Boca Tauce\n— 10.8 km from the Teide Cable Car.\nA little further away, this viewpoint stands at the junction of two roads (leading to Vilaflor and Chío, respectively). From here, it is possible to see the lava streams emitted by the most recent eruption of the Pico Viejo volcano in 1798.\nBoca Tauce Viewpoint in the Teide National Park\nMirador de las Narices del Teide\n— 14.1 km from the Teide Cable Car.\nThis viewing point in the south of the island is the furthest from the cable car, but it does afford views of Pico Viejo, Tenerife’s second-highest volcano with an altitude of 3,100 metres.\nLas Narices del Teide Viewpoint in the Teide National Park\nMirador del Pico Viejo\n— located on the slopes of the Teide volcano\nViews from the Pico Viejo Viewpoint on Mount Teide\nAnother equally (maybe even more) attractive alternative way of viewing the volcano is to ascend in the cable car, and go on to visit the Pico Viejo Viewpoint with a guide who will explain how the surrounding landscape was formed.\nIf you prefer to travel to the cable car on an organised excursion with departures from Tenerife’s main tourist resorts, and would rather explore the trail to the Pico Viejo Viewing Point with a digital audioguide, we can strongly recommend the Teide Tour excursion.\nMirador del Llano de Ucanca\n— 6.4 km from the Teide Cable Car.\nThis is one of the main plateaux to be found within the Teide National Park, and from its viewing point you can see the two highest volcanoes and the Roques de García. When it snows, this area takes on a special beauty thanks to the contrast between the white snow and the blue of the sky.\nView of the Llano de Ucanca plain in the Teide National Park\nMirador de los Roques de García\n— 4.5 km from the Teide Cable Car.\nThere is little more we can add to what has already been said about these rocky formations that rise up at one end of the plain known as the Llano de Ucanca. This is a stop-off you won’t want to miss, not least for the chance of a photo with the volcano in the background silhouetted against the sky. Another viewpoint, the Mirador de la Ruleta, offers a rather different panorama of the plain and La Catedral, which you may want to get a closer look at in order to appreciate its unusual structure.\nViews from the Los Roques de García Viewpoint in the Teide National Park\nMirador del Tabonal Negro\n— 2.1 km from the Teide Cable Car.\nFrom here, you can obtain a good view of the Siete Cañadas; it is also an ideal spot to see the tajinastes in flower in the spring.\nThe name Tabonal Negro derives from a sharp-edged stone known as a tabona , which is the same colour and was used by the Guanches to make cutting tools.\nTabonal Negro Viewpoint in the Teide National Park\nMirador Minas de San José\n— 4.9 km from the Teide Cable Car.\nThis viewing point owes its name to former mineral mining operations in the area. The view from this point enables one to fully appreciate the arid nature of the volcanic landscape. Indeed, it bears a strong resemblance to the surface of Mars.\nLas Minas de San José in the Teide National Park\nCable Car Visitors’ Centre\n- Directions.\nOver time, facilities at Teide Cable Car base station have evolved to cater to visitors who are interested in learning more about the many unique aspects of Teide National Park. It has added new, fascinating services and has now become a proper Visitors’ Centre at the foot of the volcano. Today, the Cable Car Visitors’ Centre is an essential place to visit on any day of the year.\nThe existing services, a souvenir shop with interesting, handcrafted goods from the Canary Islands, and a restaurant with wonderful panoramic views of the National Park that serves local produce with the distinct flavour of the island, are now joined by the “Science and Legend” exhibition by Teide Legend . The exhibition is based around the legend of Guayota, who was believed to inhabit Echeyde (Teide), and recounts the story of Tenerife’s biggest volcanic eruption, which occurred over a thousand years ago, from the perspectives of the Guanche legend and science.\n\nRoques de García\n— 4.5 km from the Teide Cable Car.\nWithout doubt, one of the Park’s most famous and photographed rock formations.

What to do in the Teide National Park\nIn view of the large number of attractions to be found in the National Park, it can be more difficult to decide what to do on Mount Teide as the possibilities range from using the cable car, through visiting the Teide Observatory to going hiking or to enjoying the magic of the starlit sky at nightfall.\nTravel up Mount Teide by cable car\nThere is no doubt that the star activity on a visit to the Teide National Park is the cable car ride , which ascends to an altitude of 3,555 metres in the area known as La Rambleta, the starting point of 3 trails around the summit.\nFrom La Rambleta you can access, without needing a permit, the La Fortaleza trail (which offers views of the north of the island and the fabulous sea of clouds), or the trail that leads to the Pico Viejo Viewpoint, with glorious views of the island’s southern slopes, with some of the neighbouring islands visible on the horizon—a guided tour can be booked for this route.\nThose who prefer not to go walking can stay to admire the magnificent views of Las Cañadas from the Mirador de La Rambleta.\nAt present, there is no free access to the Telesforo Bravo path leading to the summit: you need to obtain a free permit in advance of your visit from the Teide National Park to climb up and circle the mouth of the volcano—you will find more information in this complete guide on how to reach the peak of Mount Teide .\nTeide Cable Car in the National Park\nOne thing you need to be mindful of on your visit to the National Park is your clothing, which must be suitable for a high-altitude environment.

We can find lush vegetation at any access point to Las Cañadas, and especially at those in the north (La Esperanza and La Orotava). However, once past these wooded areas, we reach a point above 2,000 metres where the flora and fauna struggle to adapt to the terrain.\nAt the El Portillo Visitors’ Centre, we can learn a great deal about Mount Teide’s flora , as the centre has a unique Botanical Garden.\nHowever, a good challenge for visitors to Mount Teide is to find the two types of endemic violet that grow here, the Teide violet and the Guajara violet .\nSpectacular specimen of the Guajara violet\nWhere fauna is concerned, highlights are the tarentola or wall gecko, Gallot’s lizard or the Tenerife lizard, and the Canary long-eared bat, as well as birds such as the kestrel and the Teide finch among others.\nA sustainable visit to Mount Teide\nAs we have shown, there is a great deal to see in the Teide National Park , a unique place in the world—and we want it to remain so for many years to come.\nFor this reason, we need to take care of it, support sustainability and, as far as possible, travel to see it in shared transport, something which is possible thanks to these Tenerife Teide excursions.\nIn other words, we need to become “Teidelovers”, and follow a few basic rules that any nature lover must respect.\n\nTravel up Mount Teide by cable car\nThere is no doubt that the star activity on a visit to the Teide National Park is the cable car ride , which ascends to an altitude of 3,555 metres in the area known as La Rambleta, the starting point of 3 trails around the summit.\nFrom La Rambleta you can access, without needing a permit, the La Fortaleza trail (which offers views of the north of the island and the fabulous sea of clouds), or the trail that leads to the Pico Viejo Viewpoint, with glorious views of the island’s southern slopes, with some of the neighbouring islands visible on the horizon—a guided tour can be booked for this route.\nThose who prefer not to go walking can stay to admire the magnificent views of Las Cañadas from the Mirador de La Rambleta.\nAt present, there is no free access to the Telesforo Bravo path leading to the summit: you need to obtain a free permit in advance of your visit from the Teide National Park to climb up and circle the mouth of the volcano—you will find more information in this complete guide on how to reach the peak of Mount Teide .\nTeide Cable Car in the National Park\nOne thing you need to be mindful of on your visit to the National Park is your clothing, which must be suitable for a high-altitude environment. Much depends on the time of year, but at 3,555 metres it’s probably going to be much colder than normal, so it’s a good idea to make sure you are well informed and prepared so that you have an enjoyable experience.\nRecommendations regarding clothing and equipment for a visit to the Teide National Park\n\nSee the sunset from Mount Teide\nIf there is one magical moment in the Park, it is at sunset.

This route is one of the most appreciated by those who ascend Mount Teide by cable car. BOOK NOW\n\nBackground to the Teide Cable Car\nDon Andrés de Arroyo y González de Chávez, who spearheaded the Teide cable car project.\nThroughout our history, several ideas and proposals emerged to construct a cable car system to make it possible for all kinds of visitors to travel to the peak of Mount Teide.\nHowever, the only project to eventually see the light of day was suggested by Don Andrés de Arroyo y González de Chávez .\nDuring his travels in Germany and Switzerland back in 1929, he had been impressed by the number of funicular railways in the regions he was visiting, and by the superb views afforded from the height of the stations.\nOn his return, he decided to spare no effort in providing Mount Teide with a funicular railway that would provide access for all visitors, so that they could enjoy the wonderful views from the peak.\n\nThe project: the first steps towards a cable car system\nDon Andrés de Arroyo resolved to bring about the Teide cable car project.\nThe initial construction project was drawn up in 1930 by the Engineer for Roads, Canals and Ports, Don José Ochoa Benjumea . This was an aerial railway system divided into two sections: The first would connect Montaña Majúa with Montaña Fría, with two cabins travelling to and fro, and capacity for 35 passengers. The second section would depart from Montaña Fría with a single cabin for up to 15 passengers, finishing at the terminus.\nIn 1960, the final report and project were written for the building of the system, based on the original project drafted by Engineer Ochoa.\nIn the definitive project, the site of the first station was switched from Montaña Majúa to its current location, eliminating the need for one tower and reducing the cost of cable.\nThe final project was drawn up by the Engineer for Roads, Canals and Ports, Don Miguel Pintor Domingo and the industrial engineer Don Francisco Trujillo Armas.\n\nThe layout of the cable car track\nView of the cable car route to the upper station\nThe specific route was chosen to take advantage of the sloping terrain; this made it easier to build the derricks or towers, as it aligned the initial station with the only place where the intermediate station could be sited, given that the land is solid rock. In addition, this meant that derricks were not needed for the construction of the upper station.\nThe Teide cable car operates as a push-pull system, using two cabins that travel using a traction cable. Each cabin glides along an additional cable that acts as a track, travelling for almost 2.5 kilometres and reaching a maximum speed of 8 metres per second. During the journey, the cabins pass through four 50-metre-tall towers that support the cables. Over the entire journey, the cable car ascends 1,200 metres, with the upper station sited at 3,555 metres above sea level.\n\nBuilding the cable car: start and completion dates\nImage showing the construction of the Teide cable car base station\nConstruction of the cable car system began in April 1962, with the marking out of the route the track would take and with surveys of the land. This work was completed in 1963, and it determined the exact location of the stations and the four derricks or towers that would support the cable.\nBuilding work began on the 4th of September 1963 with the excavation for the construction of the access road to the site of the base station. Construction of the cable car system took 8 years, and was completed on the 27th of July 1971 with the signing of the provisional certificate of acceptance for the first section of the funicular railway.\nThe main difficulties occurred in winter, as snowfall and low temperatures meant that it was often only possible to work on the base station.\nTo begin with, building materials were brought up by donkeys (or even carried on the shoulders of the workmen themselves) until a hoist was installed, and in 1967 an auxiliary cable car track was brought into operation, speeding up the building work.\nThe civil works and the foundations were undertaken by Entrecanales y Tabora S.A., while the installation of the funicular railway itself was carried out by the Italian company Ceretti e Tanfani S.A.\n\nThe cable car’s inaugural journey\nPhotograph of the first Teide cable car cabins in operation.\nThe cable car opened on the 18th of July 1971. On the second of August 1971, it went into operation—the start of a new adventure for the Canary Islands.\nA unique project that, since that first journey, has been enjoyed by every one of our visitors.\n\nThe refurbishment of the cable car\nRenewal of the Teide cable car cabin\nBetween 1999 and 2007 a project to refurbish the system was undertaken:\nThe existing cabins were replaced by new ones with a more modern, aerodynamic design. The aerial tramway, the traction cables and the four towers were also replaced. Improvements were made to the stations to bring them into line with new requirements and to bring them into harmony with their surroundings. All the machinery as well as the electrical power plant were also renewed. In addition, the safety and control systems were changed, and a plan was put into place for regular safety reviews.\nA significant milestone was reached between 2007 and 2008 when the towers were renewed without interrupting the passenger service , an achievement recognised by the award of the Agustín de Betancourt Prize for the best civil engineering project for the 2007-2009 three-year-period.\n\nThe energy transition of the Teide Cable Car\nIn 2024, the Teide cable car system reached a milestone in terms of sustainability when it became the first cable car service in the world not connected to mains electricity, but operating exclusively on solar energy .\nThanks to its photovoltaic panels, the Teide cable car service now operates using 100% solar energy\nFrom its early days, the energy used by the Teide cable car system came from diesel engines, as it was not possible to connect the system to the island’s electricity grid.\nHowever, the need to reduce its environmental footprint in a protected natural area led to an ambitious project to transition to a model based on renewable energies.\nThis challenge was met on the 24th of September 2024, when the cable car system began to operate using 100% renewable energy.\nThis transition has resulted in the elimination of the equivalent of 600 tonnes of CO2 emissions annually.\nThe use of solar energy has transformed the Teleférico into a model of sustainability and energy efficiency, reaffirming its commitment to responsible tourism and to preserving the natural heritage of the Teide National Park for future generations.\nThe installation of solar panels was a major step towards sustainability for the Teide Cable Car.\n* Authorship of the images and text of the History of the Cable Car (up to the section ‘The energy transition of the Teide Cable Car’) by Rafael Cedrés .\nLinkedIn: Rafael Cedrés Jorge\nFurther information:\nwww.cedres.info www.cedres.info/2008/09/el-teleferico-del-teide.html"

Before planning your visit, it's important to check the current conditions.\n\nAt the base station (2,356 m), temperatures typically range from 5°C to 25°C in summer and from -5°C to 15°C in winter. At the upper station (3,555 m), temperatures are typically 10-15°C lower. Wind chill can make it feel significantly colder.\n\nThe cable car may close temporarily or for the entire day due to adverse weather conditions. The most common reason for closure is high winds at the upper station. Other factors include ice on the cables, poor visibility, and electrical storms.\n\nKey weather factors to consider:\n\n- Temperature: Always bring warm clothing, regardless of the season. Temperatures at 3,555 m can be below 0°C even in summer.\n- Wind: High winds are common at altitude and can cause the cable car to close. Winds above 40 km/h typically result in suspension of service.\n- UV radiation: At 3,555 m, UV radiation is approximately 30% more intense than at sea level. Always wear sunscreen, sunglasses, and a hat.\n- Cloud cover: The \"sea of clouds\" phenomenon is common — the base station may be above the clouds while the coast is cloudy, or vice versa.\n\nWe update our weather information daily. For real-time conditions, check our webcams showing live views from the base station and upper station.\n\nIf the cable car is closed due to weather, affected ticket holders can reschedule their visit free of charge or request a full refund."

For date changes to a ticket with a lower price, the difference between the initially purchased ticket and the new requested ticket will be refunded. Otherwise, i.e., for date changes to tickets with a higher price, the booking must be cancelled and a new purchase made.\nSince the operation of the Cable Car is subject to the changing weather (wind speed, temperature, etc.), on occasions, the estimated boarding time may be delayed.\nIf a temporary service interruption due to adverse weather conditions or technical reasons causes a delay of at least 90 minutes in relation to the booked time, the full refund of the amount may be requested free of charge provided that the tickets have not been used.\nFor the Sunset & Stars activity, date changes or cancellations can be made free of charge up to 48 hours prior to the activity. After this period, the cancellation carries a charge of 50% of the amount. If the cancellation takes place with less than 24 hours’ notice, 100% of the amount will be charged.\nFor the Brunch with Teide Cable Car Ticket activity, reservations may be cancelled or the date of the activity may be changed free of charge up to 48 hours prior to the activity. After this period, 100% of the amount will be charged.\nFor private activities (except those including the Ascent to the Peak of Mount Teide), date changes or cancellations can be made free of charge up to 72 hours prior to the activity. After this period, the cancellation carries a charge of 50% of the amount. If the cancellation takes place with less than 24 hours’ notice, 100% of the amount will be charged. Up to 3 date changes within a maximum of 1 year are permitted.\nFor all other activities, date changes or cancellations can be made free of charge up to 24 hours prior to the activity. After this period, 100% of the amount will be charged.\nSince hiking activities ‘Climbing the Teide Crater with the help of the Cable Car’ and ‘VIP ascent to the Peak by Cable Car’ include the permit to access the crater, we do not admit changes or cancellations once booking has been confirmed. This is due to the way the Teide National Park’s permit issuing system works.\nBecause we market certain experiences provided by"

This means that if a user accepts cookies, certain data belonging to the user will be shared with Google (i.e. the purchasing customer’s e-mail). The e-mail will be hashed using the SH-256 algorithm so that all information is sent in code to respect users’ privacy. SHA-256 guarantees data integrity and cannot be reversed to obtain the original data to securely respect privacy.\nIf a user doesn’t accept cookies, they will only be sent an anonymous ping that reports the conversion and does not contain any of the user’s identifiable data or a hashed e-mail.\nIn terms of anonymity and exercising the right to erase data, data are not stored as such in Google Ads so the Enhanced Conversions function is not affected.\nTELEFÉRICO DEL PICO DE TEIDE, S.A. uses customer data, such as e-mail addresses, to create personalised marketing campaigns through third-party platforms using the Google Ads Customer Match feature.
